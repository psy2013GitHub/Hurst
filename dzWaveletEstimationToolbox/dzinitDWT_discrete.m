%
%    This function performs the initialization step of the DWT for a special kind
%    of process linked to the discrete time series X(k) supplied. 
%    In effect it enables the DWT to be used to study such intrinsically discrete time series.
%    From the X(k) supplied a band limited cts time process ~X(t) is defined, with X(k) = ~X(k)
%    via the sinc expansion. This function calculates the approximation coefficients for ~X(t):
%    
%           a(k) = integral^infty_infty  ~X(t) phi(t-k) dt   
%
%    where phi(t) is the scale function of the MRA underlying the DWT. The integrals
%           I(m) = integral^infty_infty  sinc(t+m) phi(t) dt  have been precalculated in
%    calc_initfilterDWT_discrete.m  and so this routine can calculate the a(k) simply via
%    the discrete convolution:
%                                 a(k) = (X*I)(k)

%  Input:   data:  the discrete time series  X(k),  k in [1,2,... n] 
%           regu:  (regularity) =  number of vanishing moments (of the Daubechies wavelet).
%           lengthIwant:   the desired filter length.  If =0, the automated length selection method
%                       is chosen:  symmetric truncation if necessary to 1/8th of the data length. Otherwise
%                       the requested length is used if possible (can't exceed the stored length).
%                       It is not allowed however to exceed the data length.  Warning messages are
%                       printed in these cases.
%           printout:  if = 1 , have plots and information on the filter and the approximation series
%                         = 0 , no output except the warning messages if applicable.
%
%  Output:  appro: The approximation coefficents at level zero (set to correspond to deltat=1)
%           kfirst: The time t=k which the first element of appro corresponds to.     
%           klast:  The time t=k which the last  element of appro corresponds to.
%         For both of these time is on the scale of t in ~X(t), which is that of k in X(k).
